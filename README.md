# eppz! (C# theme for Rider IDE)

![theme_screenshot](screenshot.png)


Very bare-bones port of eppz! theme. Currently (19.07.2022) Rider does not allow separate colors for specific keywords which makes porting this theme 1-1 almost impossible. Nonetheless, maybe someone will find it helpful.

Recommended to use alongside OneDark editor theme:
1. Preferences -> Appearance & Behavior -> Get More Themes
2. Install and choose OneDark theme
3. Preferences -> Editor -> Color Scheme -> press "cog" button -> Import Scheme -> eppz_theme.jar
